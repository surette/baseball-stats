You have been asked to create a web application that shows a sortable table of baseball player statistics. The table should show the following statistics for each hitter: AVG, HR, RBI, RUNS, SB, and OPS. The default sort should be by AVG, descending. Clicking on a column header should sort the data by the selected column, without reloading the page. Anticipating that many thousands of player records will be a part of this system, only the data relevant to the current display should be sent to the browser; do not send all rows at once. Clicking on the same column that is currently being used to sort the players should flip the direction of the sort. Only 25 players should be shown at a time (the top or bottom 25 depending on if it's descending or ascending). The linked xml file [1] contains statistics for all of the baseball players in the Major Leagues during the 1998 season. Assume you'll eventually have access to similar files for every year from 1930-2005, but in order to provide a proof of concept, you only need to display sortable statistics from 1998.
